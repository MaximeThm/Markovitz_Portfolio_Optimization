# Markovitz_Portfolio_Optimization

This python programme enables the optimal allocation of the selected assets to be obtained by following modern portfolio theory. 

Modern portfolio theory (MPT), or mean-variance analysis, is a mathematical framework for assembling a portfolio of assets such that the expected return is maximized for a given level of risk. It is a formalization and extension of diversification in investing, the idea that owning different kinds of financial assets is less risky than owning only one type. Its key insight is that an asset's risk and return should not be assessed by itself, but by how it contributes to a portfolio's overall risk and return. It uses the variance of asset prices as a proxy for risk.

Economist Harry Markowitz introduced MPT in a 1952 essay, for which he was later awarded a Nobel Prize in Economics.

# Input of the programm :

- list of tickers (from Yahoo Finance) : TSLA, AMZN, AAPL in this example
- start and end date of the period studied : 2520 days prior from today in the example (e.g. 10 years as a year as an average of 252 trading days)
- number of visual representation : 1000 in this example

# Output of the programm :

- the optimal weights of the assets or stocks you have choosen
- a nice visual representation of the efficient frontier (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_frontier for more information)


For the variables choosen here, the outputs are :
